OUTLINE FOR HOMEWORK 09 - INHERITANCE

I intend to create a hierarchial tree of the different types of bread-like food items.
This includes: Sandwiches, Calzones, Burgers, Tacos, Burritos, and Hot Dogs.
I will create a Main test class and method to initalize these food Objects and preform operations on them.
Examples of testing: Adding condiments, denoting the type of filling, and changing the acceptable condiments.

Some of the information that will be stored for each food Object:
* Country of Origin
* Display Name
* Scientific Name
* Applicable Condiments

Some of the information that will be stored for each bread-like Object:
* Number of bread slices
* Type of bread

Each non-abstract type will have its own unique values as well, such as Sub Sandwiches supporting a localized name (Hoagie, Hero, etc.).
