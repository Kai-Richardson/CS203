PROJECT TITLE: Homework 04 - CS203
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Date Checker
VERSION or DATE: 2019-02-12
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run in BlueJ, Main()
If you get a missing library or import error, BlueJ is acting like the terrible IDE it is.
How to solve:
1. Re-open Project
2. Go to Tools -> Preferences
3. Go to the Libraries tab
4. Add File, navigate to ./libs/, and add the jollyday.jar
5. Reset the JVM using the arrow on the bottom right or CTRL+Shift+R
6. Success, it should work. Lament that BlueJ is so terrible.
